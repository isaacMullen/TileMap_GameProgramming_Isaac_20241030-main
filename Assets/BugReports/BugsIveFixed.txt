Fixed the bug where fish and rocks weren't regenerating properly. They were being generated by the method but the playermap was hiding them because of how I handle player movement. As the player moved it was drawing over spaces on the playermap to give the visual of replacing tiles on the evironment layer. This was causing some rocks and fish to be hidden under the path the player took last level. I fixed this by directly modifying the environment layer when the player moves instead of adding it to the players map. I also cleared-all-tiles everytime the player moves so it doesnt actually draw a map at all. The only map that matters now is the environemtn one.
